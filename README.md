# Code for ImmuNet paper 

This repository will be used to publish code that underlies analyses and figures shown in the forthcoming paper "ImmuNet: A Segmentation-Free Machine Learning Pipeline for Immune Landscape Phenotyping in Tumors by Muliplex Imaging" by Sultan et al (see preprint here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.22.464548v2).

The repository has been created already to reserve a Zenodo DOI that can be put in the manuscript that is being produced.
